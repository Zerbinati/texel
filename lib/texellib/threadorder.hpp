/**
 * The ThreadOrder class makes sure that a sequence of lock/unlock operations
 * from a set of threads are performed in a deterministic order. The order is:
 *
 *   thread 0 lock
 *   thread 0 unlock
 *   thread 1 lock
 *   thread 1 unlock
 *   ...
 *   thread N-1 lock
 *   thread N-1 unlock
 *   thread 0 lock
 *   thread 0 unlock
 *   ...
 *
 * If a thread calls the lock() function before it is its turn to run according
 * to the deterministic order, it will simply wait until other threads that
 * should run first are finished, even if the other threads have not yet called
 * the lock() function.
 *
 * To avoid deadlocks, all threads would have to lock/unlock the same number of
 * times. Since this is not realistic, there is also a quit() function that when
 * called from a thread causes that thread to no longer participate in the
 * round-robin scheduling order.
 *
 * This class can be used to implement a deterministic multithreaded search, but
 * the result will likely be much less efficient than a non-deterministic
 * multithreaded search.
 *
 * NOTE! This class uses busy wait loops, so it will be extremely inefficient if
 * there are more software threads than there are free hardware threads in the
 * system.
